          Feel free to take a look around the code to see how Remix does things,
          it might be a bit different than what youâ€™re used to. When you're
          ready to dive deeper, we've got plenty of resources to get you
          up-and-running quickly.

        <p>
          Check out all the demos in this starter, and then just delete the{" "}
          <code>app/routes/demos</code> and <code>app/styles/demos</code>{" "}
          folders when you're ready to turn this into your next project.
